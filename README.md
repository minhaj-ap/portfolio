## ⚙️ Data Management

All content (projects, blogs, testimonials, etc.) is stored in a centralized `data.json` file located in the `public` directory.  
This approach was chosen to keep the setup simple and lightweight.

> 📝 **Note:** The structure of the data (e.g., `AIproject`, `projects`) is defined using TypeScript in the context file:  
> `src\context\data-context.tsx`  
> It outlines the expected shape and types for each data section.

## 💡 Why Use Static JSON Instead of a Full Backend?

While I’m fully capable of building a complete system with:
- Database integration
- Admin panel for dynamic content management
- Authentication and role-based access

I chose to keep this version intentionally simple to save time and focus on delivering the core functionality quickly.

> The other projects featured here demonstrate my ability to build and scale full-stack systems when required.
